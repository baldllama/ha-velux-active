# VELUX Active with Netatmo — Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration for VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO, supporting full control of:

- 🪟 **Roof windows** — open, close, set position, stop (requires one-time key extraction, see below)
- 🪟 **Roller shutters & awning blinds** — open, close, set position, stop (works out of the box)
- 🔒 **Departure mode** — lock/unlock all movement via the gateway (integrates with alarm systems)
- 🌡️ **Sensors** — rain, temperature, humidity, CO₂, light intensity (via the VELUX gateway)

---

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → click the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL and select **Integration** as the category
4. Search for **Velux Active** and install it
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

Copy the `velux_active` folder into your `/config/custom_components/` directory and restart Home Assistant.

---

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Velux Active with Netatmo**
3. Enter your VELUX ACTIVE account email and password
4. On the next screen you will be asked for a **Hash Sign Key** and **Sign Key ID** — these are required for roof window control. See [Obtaining your window signing keys](#obtaining-your-window-signing-keys) below.
   - If you only have roller shutters or blinds, leave these blank and click **Submit**

---

## Obtaining your window signing keys

Roof windows require cryptographic signing for security — the API verifies that commands come from a paired device. You need to extract two keys from the VELUX app once using a man-in-the-middle proxy. This is a one-time procedure.

### What you need

- An **Android phone** (Android 8 or later) connected to the same WiFi as your VELUX gateway
- A **computer** (Mac or Linux — Windows works too with minor path adjustments)
- Your VELUX ACTIVE gateway powered on and accessible

> **iPhone users:** The iOS app uses certificate pinning that prevents interception. You need an Android device. A cheap secondhand Android phone works fine — you only need it once.

---

### Step 1 — Install tools on your computer

**Install mitmproxy:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install mitmproxy

# Linux
pip install mitmproxy
```

**Install Android platform tools (for adb):**
```bash
# macOS
brew install android-platform-tools

# Linux
sudo apt install android-tools-adb
```

**Install apktool:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install apktool

# Linux
sudo apt install apktool
```

You also need `apksigner`, which is included with Android SDK build tools. If `apksigner` is not available on your system, install Android SDK build tools and add them to your `PATH`.

Verify the tools are working:
```bash
mitmproxy --version
adb version
apktool --version
apksigner --version
```

---

### Step 2 — Enable USB debugging on your Android phone

1. Go to **Settings → About Phone**
2. Tap **Build number** (or **MIUI version** on Xiaomi) 7 times to enable Developer Options
3. Go to **Settings → Developer Options**
4. Enable **USB Debugging**
5. Connect the phone to your computer via USB and tap **Allow** when prompted

Verify the phone is detected:
```bash
adb devices
```
You should see your device listed.

---

### Step 3 — Install the patched Velux APK

Install the VELUX ACTIVE app on your phone, then pull its APK files from the device:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/velux-apks

adb shell pm path com.velux.active | tr -d '\r' | while IFS= read -r line; do
  apk="${line#package:}"
  adb pull "$apk" "$HOME/velux-apks/$(basename "$apk")"
done
```

This stores `base.apk` and any split APKs in `~/velux-apks/`.

Now decompile the base APK and patch it to trust your proxy certificate for the mitmproxy method:

```bash
# Decompile
apktool d ~/velux-apks/base.apk -o ~/velux_patched

# Patch network security config to trust user certificates
cat > ~/velux_patched/res/xml/network_security_config.xml << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system"/>
            <certificates src="user"/>
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">fw.netatmo.net</domain>
        <trustkit-config disableDefaultReportUri="true" enforcePinning="false">
            <report-uri>https://cert-pinning.netatmo.com/</report-uri>
        </trustkit-config>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
EOF

# Disable certificate pinning in the app code
# Find the pin checker class
grep -rn "Certificate pinning failure" ~/velux_patched/smali_classes2/ -l
```

Open the file found above (it will be something like `android/c00.smali`) and find the method:
```
.method public final a(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/List;)V
```

Replace its body with just `return-void` so it looks like:
```smali
.method public final a(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/List;)V
    .locals 1
    .annotation system Ldalvik/annotation/Signature;
        value = {
            "(",
            "Ljava/lang/String;",
            "Ljava/util/List<",
            "+",
            "Ljava/security/cert/Certificate;",
            ">;)V"
        }
    .end annotation

    return-void
.end method
```

Then rebuild and sign the APK:

```bash
# Generate a signing key (one time only)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/velux-key.keystore -alias velux \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -storepass password123 -keypass password123 \
  -dname "CN=Velux, O=Test, C=GB"

# Rebuild
rm -rf ~/velux_patched/build
apktool b ~/velux_patched -o ~/velux-patched.apk

# If apktool fails with drawable/resource errors, see the note below.

# Sign
mkdir -p ~/velux-signed

apksigner sign \
  --ks ~/velux-key.keystore \
  --ks-pass pass:password123 \
  --key-pass pass:password123 \
  --out ~/velux-signed/base.apk \
  ~/velux-patched.apk
```

> **Rebuild note:** If `apktool b` fails with drawable/resource errors, check for empty drawable entries in `res/values/drawables.xml` and replace them with transparent values such as `#00000000`. Some APK versions may also need `android:drawable="@null"` items replaced with transparent shape items.

Also sign any split APKs pulled from the device:
```bash
for apk in ~/velux-apks/split_config*.apk; do
  [ -e "$apk" ] || continue
  apksigner sign \
    --ks ~/velux-key.keystore \
    --ks-pass pass:password123 \
    --key-pass pass:password123 \
    --out "$HOME/velux-signed/$(basename "$apk")" \
    "$apk"
done
```

Uninstall the existing app and install the patched version:
```bash
adb uninstall com.velux.active

install_apks=(~/velux-signed/base.apk)
for apk in ~/velux-signed/split_config*.apk; do
  [ -e "$apk" ] || continue
  install_apks+=("$apk")
done

adb install-multiple "${install_apks[@]}"
```

> **Note for Xiaomi / MIUI users:** You may need to disable app verification in Developer Options before the install will succeed.

---

### Step 4 — Set up mitmproxy

Find your computer's local IP address:
```bash
# macOS
ipconfig getifaddr en0

# Linux
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

Start mitmproxy:
```bash
mitmproxy --listen-port 8080 \
  --ignore-hosts "app-ws\.velux-active\.com|googleapis\.com|google\.com|gstatic\.com|crashlytics\.com|firebase\.com|flurry\.com"
```

On your Android phone:
1. Go to **Settings → WiFi** → long-press your network → **Modify network** → **Advanced options**
2. Set **Proxy** to **Manual**
3. **Host:** your computer's IP address
4. **Port:** `8080`

Install the mitmproxy certificate on your phone:
1. Open Chrome on your phone and go to `http://mitm.it`
2. Tap **Android** and download the certificate
3. Go to **Settings → Security → Install from storage → CA Certificate**
4. Install the downloaded certificate

Set the proxy on your phone via adb as well:
```bash
adb shell settings put global http_proxy YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8080
```

---

### Step 5 — Capture the keys

In a second terminal window, start watching the logs:
```bash
adb logcat -s velux-debug:W velux-input:W
```

Open the patched Velux app on your phone and log in. When prompted, press the button on your VELUX gateway to complete authentication.

Once authenticated, **tap a roof window to move it** (open or close it a little).

You should see output like this in your logcat terminal:
```
W velux-debug: AAABBBCCC123ExampleHashSignKeyGoesHere456DDDEEEFFF=
W velux-input: dGFyZ2V0X3Bvc2l0aW9uMjYxNzc3NDk2...
```

Also look in mitmproxy for a `POST /syncapi/v1/setstate` request. Select it and press Enter to view the body — you'll see:
```json
{
  "sign_key_id": "AAAAAExampleSignKeyId1234Rw==",
  ...
}
```

Your two keys are:
- **Hash Sign Key** — the value logged to `velux-debug` (e.g. `AAABBBCCC123ExampleHashSignKeyGoesHere456...`)
- **Sign Key ID** — the `sign_key_id` value from the mitmproxy request body

---

### Alternative — Capture both keys from logcat

If you prefer not to use mitmproxy, you can patch the APK to log both signing values directly to Android logcat. This is more manual than the mitmproxy method, but it avoids configuring a phone proxy and installing the mitmproxy certificate.

Start from the decompiled APK in Step 3 before rebuilding it. Search for the signing mapper:

```bash
grep -rn "HashMapperKey" ~/velux_patched/smali* | head
```

In the tested APK, the mapper was located at:

```bash
~/velux_patched/smali/android/br1.smali
```

The exact file and registers can change between app versions. Use the register from the nearby `move-result-object` line when adding each log statement.

#### Log the Sign Key ID

Find the block that reads the sign key ID, for example:

```smali
    invoke-virtual/range {p3 .. p3}, Landroid/fid;->c()[B

    move-result-object v2

    invoke-virtual {v0, v2}, Landroid/br1;->a([B)Ljava/lang/String;

    move-result-object v2
```

Add a `velux-key-id` log immediately after it:

```smali
    const-string v3, "velux-key-id"

    invoke-static {v3, v2}, Landroid/util/Log;->w(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I
```

#### Log the Hash Sign Key

Find the block that reads the hash sign key, for example:

```smali
    invoke-virtual/range {p3 .. p3}, Landroid/fid;->b()[B

    move-result-object v10

    invoke-virtual {v0, v10}, Landroid/br1;->a([B)Ljava/lang/String;

    move-result-object v10
```

Add a `velux-debug` log immediately after it:

```smali
    const-string v11, "velux-debug"

    invoke-static {v11, v10}, Landroid/util/Log;->w(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I
```

Repeat both additions once more lower in the same mapper file if the APK has two signing paths. After patching, verify the tags exist:

```bash
grep -rn 'velux-key-id\|velux-debug' ~/velux_patched/smali*
```

Then rebuild, sign, and install the APK as described in Step 3. After logging in and moving a roof window, watch the patched app logs:

```bash
adb logcat -s velux-key-id:W velux-debug:W
```

You should see output like:

```text
W velux-key-id: sign_key_id
W velux-debug: hash_sign_key
```

Your two keys are:

- **Hash Sign Key** — the `velux-debug` value
- **Sign Key ID** — the `velux-key-id` value

---

### Step 6 — Enter the keys in Home Assistant

You can enter the keys during initial setup (Step 2 of the config flow), or add them to an existing config entry:

**For an existing installation**, run this on your HA host (replace the key values with yours):

```bash
# Docker / Home Assistant OS
docker exec homeassistant python3 -c "
import json
with open('/config/.storage/core.config_entries') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
for entry in data['data']['entries']:
    if 'velux' in entry.get('domain','').lower():
        entry['data']['hash_sign_key'] = 'YOUR_HASH_SIGN_KEY_HERE'
        entry['data']['sign_key_id'] = 'YOUR_SIGN_KEY_ID_HERE'
        print('Updated:', entry['title'])
with open('/config/.storage/core.config_entries', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
"
```

Then restart Home Assistant. Your roof windows will now have full control.

---

### Step 7 — Clean up

If you used mitmproxy, remove the proxy from your phone:

1. Go to **Settings → WiFi** → your network → **Proxy → None**

```bash
# Remove proxy setting
adb shell settings put global http_proxy :0
```

You can uninstall the patched app and reinstall the regular Velux app from the Play Store. The keys are tied to your gateway pairing and do not change unless you re-pair your gateway.

---

## Window detection

The integration automatically identifies roof windows by looking for common words in the module name (Window, Fenetre, Fenster, Raam, Finestra). If your windows are not detected correctly, you can add their module IDs to `WINDOW_MODULE_IDS` in `cover.py`.

To find your module IDs, enable debug logging for this integration:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.velux_active: debug
```

Then restart HA and look for log lines like:
```
Cover entity created: id=aabbcc1122334455 name='Window 1' is_window=True signing=True
```

---

## How the signing works

The Velux API requires roof window commands to be cryptographically signed using HMAC-SHA512. This prevents unauthorized control of windows (which are openings in your roof and pose a weather/security risk if operated without authorisation).

The signature is computed as:
```
msg    = f"target_position{position}{timestamp}{nonce}{device_id}"
hash   = HMAC-SHA512(key=base64decode(HashSignKey), msg=msg)
result = base64encode(hash).replace('+', '-').replace('/', '_')
```

When multiple windows are commanded simultaneously (e.g. via a group), they are sent in a single API call with incrementing nonces (0, 1, 2, 3...) and the same timestamp — matching the behaviour of the official Velux app.

---

## Auto Ventilation

Each roof window has an **Auto Ventilation** switch (`switch.window_name_auto_ventilation`). When enabled, the VELUX gateway automatically adjusts the window position based on indoor CO₂ levels, temperature and humidity. When disabled, the window only moves in response to manual commands from HA or the Velux app.

This is useful for automations — for example, disabling auto ventilation when you leave home and re-enabling it when you return.

```yaml
# Disable auto ventilation when away
- action: switch.turn_off
  target:
    entity_id:
      - switch.window_1_auto_ventilation
      - switch.window_2_auto_ventilation
      - switch.window_3_auto_ventilation
      - switch.window_4_auto_ventilation
```

---

## Departure Mode (Lock)

The integration exposes the VELUX gateway's departure mode as a **lock entity** (`lock.velux_departure_mode`). When locked, the gateway disables all window and blind movement — useful for integrating with a home alarm system.

- **Locked** = away mode (all movement disabled)
- **Unlocked** = home mode (normal operation)

The lock state is read directly from the gateway on every poll — it survives HA restarts and reflects the true state even if departure mode was toggled from the Velux app.

### Locking requires signing keys

Activating departure mode (locking) works without signing keys. **Deactivating** departure mode (unlocking) requires the Hash Sign Key and Sign Key ID to be configured, as the API requires a signed command to re-enable movement for security reasons.

### Example automation — activate with alarm

```yaml
alias: Velux lock when alarm set
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: alarm_control_panel.my_alarm
    to:
      - armed_away
      - armed_home
actions:
  - action: lock.lock
    target:
      entity_id: lock.velux_departure_mode

---

alias: Velux unlock when alarm disarmed
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: alarm_control_panel.my_alarm
    to: disarmed
actions:
  - action: lock.unlock
    target:
      entity_id: lock.velux_departure_mode
```

---

## Entities

After setup the following entities are created:

**Per roof window** (requires signing keys):
- `cover.window_name` — open, close, set position, stop
- `switch.window_name_auto_ventilation` — enable/disable automatic ventilation algorithm

**Per roller shutter / awning blind:**
- `cover.blind_name` — open, close, set position, stop

**Gateway:**
- `lock.velux_departure_mode` — departure mode lock
- `binary_sensor.velux_gateway_rain_detected` — rain detection

> **Note:** Secure position and rain position sensors are planned for a future release pending pyatmo support for these fields.

---

## Troubleshooting

### API rate limit errors (error code 26 / 429)

The Netatmo API has rate limits shared across all integrations using your account. If you see errors like:

```
API limit exceeded. This could be your Application limit or User limit.
```

This means your account has been temporarily throttled. It will clear on its own within 30–60 minutes. To avoid triggering it:

- Do not restart Home Assistant repeatedly in quick succession
- Avoid setting a polling interval below 30 seconds
- Be aware that the fast polling mode (triggered after a movement command) is automatically cancelled if a rate limit is detected

If you are hitting rate limits regularly during normal use, check whether another integration is also polling the Netatmo API on the same account.

### Windows showing Unknown state on startup

This can happen if the gateway is temporarily offline or the API is rate limited when HA starts. The integration will automatically retry on the next poll. If windows remain Unknown after a few minutes, check that your VELUX gateway has a solid green light and internet access.

### Gateway goes offline

If the gateway loses its cloud connection (shown by the Velux app also being unable to control devices), the integration will keep retrying. Power cycling the gateway (unplug for 30 seconds) usually resolves this.
